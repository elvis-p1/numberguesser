# numberguesser 

The program gets a number range from the user and generates a random number between it. The user can input integers to guess this number. 
The program tells you how many guesses you have each time you guess and can restart after finishing your guesses. 

The program tells you if you get the number right or wrong, and what the number was if you could not guess within the allowed amount of guesses.
